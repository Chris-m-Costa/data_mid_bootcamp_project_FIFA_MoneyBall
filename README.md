## FIFA MoneyBall Project

This was an early project in my data analytics bootcamp course.
The project centers around a dataset of all players in the 2021 eddition of the EA Sports FIFA soccer video game. Statistical and machine learning analysis techniques were applied to the data.
The goal of the project (in addition to a general knowledge check up at this point in the course) was to atempt to determine the best replacment option for a new vacancy at a given position.
