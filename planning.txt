FIFA Project Planning


Decide on a problem/question to solve
Potential questions:
	The team needs a striker. Whats the best OVA and Total Stats fro the least $$
	


Stage 2:
Data Cleaning:
	standardization
	dropping unneeded or unuseable cols
	Removing/fixing nulls
	Corr3ecting Data/Column types/Removing symbols etc.

	
Stage 3:
Visualiztation: line and scatter plots to visulaize date

Filtering subject columns for team budgetary reasons



Final Thoughts:

My finidings show that there are good value for money players with a budget of ~1.5 times the total signing cost IQR.
It is also clear to see that Christiano Ronaldo is signifacntly underpaid compared to his peers at the top of the OVA column.

Unfortunately our regression model was un helpful in projecting signing costs of a potential unknwon player with an OVA rating.
